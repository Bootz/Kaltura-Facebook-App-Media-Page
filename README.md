Kaltura Media Page for Facebook Pages
=====================================
Kaltura Media Page allows you to create a gallery of videos for your Facebook Page. When users visit your Facebook page they can click on the MediaPage tab and view a category or playlist of videos that you preselect using the administrator console.

How to get started
------------------
Simply <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dialog/pagetab?app_id=340820556008773&next=http://204.236.255.97/MediaPage/" target="_blank">click here</a> and add the Page Tab to your desired Facebook Page. Once added, the application will redirect you to the administrator console where you may log in using your Kaltura credentials. Just select a player from your Kaltura account and then either a category or a playlist. Then select 3 featured videos from your category/playlist that you would like prominently featured below the main player. Once you are done making your selections, submit the settings and you will be taken to your gallery.
